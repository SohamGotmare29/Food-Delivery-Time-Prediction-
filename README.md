# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction- (Regression model)

•	 Estimating the delivery time is a significant challenge for food delivery services,as several factors like type of food, vehicle condition, weather conditions, and traffic conditions can affect it.
•	 Therefore, achieving precise delivery time predictions can enhance customer satisfaction and improve the overall efficiency of the food delivery service
•	 Cleaned, analysed the dataset and developed a Machine Learning model that predicts the food delivery time using model like XGBoost with 83% accuracy.
